MCNP to iGeom/CAD converter: a program to extract the geomtery from MCNP 
input files and write it out using any ITAPS iGeom backend. The default
output format is ACIS .sat files.

This program is currently maintained by Steve Jackson (sjackson@cae.wisc.edu).
Bug reports are appreciated.


Compiling (with CGM):

At present, you must edit the top line of the Makefile so that CGM_BASE_DIR
points to a valid installation of the CGM library.  

In addition, any shared libraries required by CGM must be located either in 
standard system directories, or in a location pointed to by the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  If your version of CGM was compiled 
against CUBIT, you  will likely need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cubit10.2/bin 

If your CGM is older and lacks the iGeom_createCone() function, you must
also remove the -DHAVE_IGEOM_CONE argument from the CXXFLAGS in the 
Makefile.  


Running:

The program requires a single command-line argument: the path to an MCNP
input file.  Optionally, the -o flag can be used to specify the file to
which output should be written.  The iGeom backend will choose the output
format based on the extension of the output file name; .sat is recommended.

Help on other command-line flags is available by invoking the program with
the -h (or --help) flag.  

Users preparing input geometries for DAGMC should use the -m flag (which 
tags volumes with their associated material properties) and the -g flag 
(which creates a DAGMC 'graveyard' boundary volume).



Unsupported Features: 

* Unsupported features that could be added easily:
** More direct control over the size of the sphere/graveyard in which
   the geometry sits
** Support for interpolation (nI/nILOG) and multiplication (nM) syntax.
** Remove dependence on exceptions: the code makes use of exceptions to abort
   itself under internal error situations, but it would be straightforward to
   change this if we need to support a more primitive compiler.


* Unsupported features that would take a modest development effort to add:
** Use autotools to simplify user installation, particularly as regards finding
   CGM's library dependencies and the availability of iGeom_createCone()
** Correct handling of hexagonal prism lattices for lattices based on irregular
   hexgons
** Support for ELL (ellipse), WED (wedge), and ARB (arbitrary polyhedron) 
   macrobodies
** Ability to refer to individual facets of macrobodies as surfaces in cell
   specification, using the NNNN.MM syntax.
** Support for lattices in universe 0
** Faster/more efficient generation of embedded universes within lattices.
** Complete support for M=-1 argument in TRn (transform) cards.
** Automatically annotate reflecting/white boundaries and periodic surfaces.
** Support for 3-arg and 5-arg specification of rotations in transformations.


* Unsupported features that would require major additions to iGeom and/or 
  a major additional development effort:
** General support for SQ, GQ, X, Y, and Z surfaces.
** Robust error detection and reporting for ill-formed MCNP inputs.
** Support for jump (nJ) syntax: requires knowledge of default values in 
   many possible contexts


Compiling a 32-bit mcnp2cad: 

Users on 64-bit Linux may need to compile a 32-bit version of this program 
under certain conditions-- for example, if only a 32-bit copy of Cubit 10.2 
is available.  This is a two-step process:
* Ensure that CGM is built for 32-bit by configuring it with the --enable-32bit 
  flag, and
* Add -m32 to the CXXFLAGS in the mcnp2cad Makefile.
